# Compiler project 
At the beginning, please download ANTLR 3.5.2 with the link below. The project is divided into several parts including language definition, lexical analyzer, C-grammar, symbol table handlings, parser, and code generation.

**ANTLR 3.5.2 Download:** https://www.antlr3.org/download.html
## Project
**● Project 1:** Write a lexical analyzer "mylexer.g" file to choose the a set of language features.


**● Project 2:** Write a syntax analyzer "myparser.g" file to decide the set of language feature.


**● Project 3:** Implement a C interpreter.


**● Project 4:** Write a "myC.g" to generate x86 code (.s files) for executing C codes on my own compiler.  
　　　　　&nbsp;Input 1, 2, 3 will be the testing files to check if the error detection works.
